[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/freedomofpress/securedrop-client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/freedomofpress/securedrop-client)

Qt-based client for working with SecureDrop submissions on the SecureDrop Qubes Workstation. In Qubes, this application runs within a VM that has no direct network access, and files open in individual, non-networked, disposable VMs. API requests and responses to and from the SecureDrop application server are sent through an intermediate VM using the [Qubes SecureDrop proxy](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-proxy). For additional background, see the [main SecureDrop Workstation repository](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation), and read about the [user research and design work that informs this work](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/wiki/Qubes-Journalist-Workstation).

**IMPORTANT:** This project is in alpha and should not be used in production environments. There are known bugs which can be found in this projectâ€™s issue tracker.

# Current limitations

This client is under active development and currently supports a minimal feature set. Major supported features include:

- the download and decryption of files, messages, and replies (using [Qubes split-gpg](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/))
- the display of decrypted messages and replies in a new conversation view
- the opening of all files in individual, non-networked, Qubes disposable VMs

Features to be added include:

- Reply to sources (encrypted client-side) - tracked in https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/issues/16. These replies will be encrypted both to individual sources, and to the submission key of the instance. Source public keys are provided by the journalist API.
- Deletion of source collection - tracked in https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/issues/18. This will delete all files associated with a source both locally and on the server.
- Export workflows - tracked in https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/issues/21. These workflows (initially a USB drive) enable a journalist to transfer a document out of the Qubes workstation and to another computer for further analysis or sharing with the rest of the newsroom.

## Getting Started

Set up a Python 3 virtual environment and set up dependencies:

```
pipenv install --dev --keep-outdated
pipenv shell
```

Please install system libraries for PyQt rather than using PyPI-managed libraries- this makes packaging possible later. On Debian, `apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtsvg` will install what you need.

In order to run the test suite you should also install the `xvfb` package (to
make the `xvfb-run` command available): `apt install xvfb`.

### OSX

```
# install Homebrew https://brew.sh/

brew install pyenv
# follow step 3 onwards of https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout
pyenv install 3.5.0

brew install pip
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev --keep-outdated
pipenv shell
```

## Run the client

You can then run the client with an ephemeral data directory:

```
./run.sh
```

If you want to persist data across restarts, you will need to run the client with:

```
./run.sh --sdc-home /path/to/my/dir/
```


## Debugging

To use `pdb`, add these lines:

```
from PyQt5.QtCore import pyqtRemoveInputHook; pyqtRemoveInputHook()
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```
Then you can use [`pdb` commands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands) as normal.

## Running against a test server

In order to login, or take other actions involving network access, you will need to use the SecureDrop server dev container.

Follow the instructions [in the SecureDrop documentation](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/setup_development.html#quick-start) to set that up.

The client uses the [SecureDrop SDK](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-sdk) to interact with the [SecureDrop Journalist API](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/journalist_api.html).
After you run the server container, the journalist interface API will be running on `127.0.0.1:8081` with a test journalist, admin, and test sources and replies.

To ensure that file decryption works, please import [this test private key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/0a901362b84a5378fba80e9cd0ffe4542bdcd598/securedrop/tests/files/test_journalist_key.sec) into your GnuPG keyring. Submissions in the SecureDrop server dev environment can be decrypted with this test key.
